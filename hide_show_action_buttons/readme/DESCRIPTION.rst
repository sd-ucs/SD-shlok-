The Hide Action Buttons module allows users to customize their experience by hiding or showing specific buttons through user configuration. You have the flexibility to show or hide buttons like export, archive, duplicate, create, edit, delete, print, import and more by adjusting user access rights. Activate the hide access for a specific user, models, and the selected button or action will be hidden just for them, while the rest of the users will still be able to see it.
